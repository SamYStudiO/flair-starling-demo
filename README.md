# flair-starling-demo
This is a demo project for [flair-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/SamYStudiO/flair-gradle-plugin) using [Starling](https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework) original [demo](http://gamua.com/starling/demo/).
Starling demo sources have also been modify to include [Feathers](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/feathers) Screen navigation (and layout) since Flair relies on Feathers Screen to manage resources.
